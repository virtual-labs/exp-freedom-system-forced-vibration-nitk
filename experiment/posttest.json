        "a": "Correct, the right answer is (a). When a system vibrates at one of its natural frequencies, it is said to be in a natural mode. These natural modes correspond to the inherent vibrational patterns of the system, unaffected by external forces.",
        "b": "The right answer is (a). The natural frequency of an oscillatory system refers to the rate at which it tends to vibrate in the absence of any external disturbance.",
        "c": "The right answer is (a). Solution is the answer for any equation of motion in th context of vibration.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (b). Coupled algebraic Riccati equations arise when solving optimal control problems. For instance, minimizing the quadratic cost in jump linear systems involves solving these equations with specific constraints.",
        "b": "Correct, the right answer is (b). For a 2DOF system, the equation of motions are in the form of coupled differential equation because in 2DOF system, one mass movement is dependent on another mass' movement.",
        "c": "The right answer is (b). Uncoupled equations are used in single DOF vibrational system.",

        "b": "The right answer is (c). The first mode's frequency can be higher than the second mode. There is no way to say that only the natural frequency of second mode is higher than first mode.",
        "c": "Correct, the right answer is (c). In a 2-DOF system, there are two natural frequencies (first mode and second mode) and corresponding mode shapes. The damping ratio influences the rate of energy dissipation and affects the amplitude of vibrations in both modes.",
        "d": "The right answer is (c). The stiffness matrix for a 2-DOF system is generally not diagonal unless the modes are uncoupled (i.e., no cross-coupling between modes)."
