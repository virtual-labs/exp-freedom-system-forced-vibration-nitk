        "a": "Correct, the right answer is (a). When a harmonic force (external force with a sinusoidal time variation) acts upon a 2-DOF (Two-Degree-of-Freedom) system, the system vibrates at the same frequency as the applied force.",
        "b": "The right answer is (a). When the applied force frequency is smaller than the natural frequency, the system does not resonate. Instead, it responds with a smaller amplitude, and the phase difference between the force and displacement is not 180 degrees.",
        "c": "The right answer is (a). If the applied force frequency were larger than the natural frequency, the system would still vibrate, but not necessarily in resonance. The amplitude would be smaller compared to resonance.",
